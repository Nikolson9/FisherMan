# FisherMan
It concerns my practice in the **C#** language in object-oriented programming, in my private lessons (<a href="https://csc.gr">https://csc.gr</a>) which contains lists (stacks, queues, dictionaries).
It makes extensive use of: associations (composition & aggregation) of classes (their objects) as well as file management.

The topic is a fishing contest with a fishing line and a net. It contains random information and enumerations. The winners are displayed at the end.
